# Tech boost month Intro to Agents

This repository contains demonstrations and exercises for building AI agents using LangChain and LangGraph frameworks.

## Overview

The project implements several types of AI agents with different capabilities:
- Conversational assistants with memory and personality traits
- Research assistants that can gather, organize, and summarize information
- Specialized agents that can route tasks to different expert sub-agents
- Custom tool integration for enhanced agent capabilities

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ (recommended 3.13)
- Google Gemini API key (for most examples)
- OpenAI API key (optional, for some examples)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a .env file in the project root with your API keys:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"  # Optional
```

## Project Structure

### Introduction Examples
- langchain_agent_demo.py - Basic LangChain agent with Wikipedia and calculator tools
- langchain_custom_tools.py - Demo of custom tool creation and integration
- langgraph_example.py - Example of building a graph-based agent with LangGraph

### Exercises
- EXERCISE_conversational_assistant.py - Implement a conversational assistant with memory, personalities, and note-taking
- EXERCISE_research_assistant_agent.py - Build a research assistant that can gather and organize information

## Usage Examples

### Basic LangChain Agent

Run a simple agent with Wikipedia and calculator tools:

```bash
python intro/langchain_agent_demo.py
```

### Custom Tools Demo

Try an agent with custom-built tools:

```bash
python intro/langchain_custom_tools.py
```

### LangGraph Multi-Agent System

Run a graph-based agent that routes questions to specialized sub-agents:

```bash
python intro/langgraph_example.py
```

### Conversational Assistant

Start a conversational assistant with memory and note-taking capabilities:

```bash
python EXERCISE_conversational_assistant.py --personality friendly
```

Available personality options: `friendly`, `professional`, `witty`

### Research Assistant

Use the research assistant to gather and organize information:

```bash
python EXERCISE_research_assistant_agent.py
```
